Stages:
- Backend (SQLite and db management)
- HTML to build each page 
- CSS 

Project Goal: Create a dashboard with options to view COVID data trends. 

Include:
- Select state and view cases/100k compared to national average 
- Select county and view cases/100k compared to state and national average
- View vaccination trends by state and county
- View deaths by state and county
- View hospital rates (e.g. % of beds occupied by COVID patients, cases that- lead to hospitilization) by state and county
- Create graphs to display above data over time

Advanced (ideally include if we have the bandwith):
 - Create heat map of which counties/states are most impacted by COVID (i.e. - cases/100k people)

Suggested methods:
 - Create module to automatically update all datasets. 

To access APIs, please refer to apis.txt.

We will update our databases at midnight each night using npm node-schedule.

NOTE: to avoid adding data that is already accounted for, we need to check the date of each data point, compare that to the dates in our dataset -> add if unaccounted.
